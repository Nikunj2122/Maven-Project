 Need to clone remote repository with local repository ?
 
- Git remote add origin (Gitgub Url name) (: - Which can be copy from gitgub account in Devops12(Example) Repo)
 
 Create one Vim file

 Creating Branch
 - git branch Feature1(Branch Name)
 How to check where we are ?
 - git branch 
 Answer - Master
 How to switch out from master to branch and barnch to master ?
- Git checkout feature1
- git status
Answer - feature1

How to create new branch and moved to that branch ?
- git checkout -b feature2
(-b stands for barnch)


How to push local repository code file to remote repository ?
- git push origin master

Push - If Want to create and update feature2 repo file (vim file3.txt) in remote repository ?
- Git barnch checkout feature2
- Git vim file3.txt
- Git add vim file3.txt
- Git commit -m "Commit message"
- Git push origin feature2 (To add feature2 changes in Remote repo and creating a Branch as Feature2)

** Diffence between Git pull and Git fetch ?
- Gitpull = git fetch + git merge 

Fetch - How to check what changes has been made in remote repository (File99) has been created in remote repo.
- Git fetch origin master
- Git branch -a (To check what changes has been made in remote repo and one branch has been created)

=> Branch has been created - (remotes/origin/master. Using this branch we could find the file99.
- Git checkout remotes/origin/master
Result - file99 has been creted.

=> If we wanna file99 in local repo or master branch ?
- Git checkout master
- Git merge origin/master
Result - You should be able to find file99 branch in Master branch.

=> Git merge and Git Rebase => Both of allows you to merge the code

Rebase - Allows you to do merageing but it should allow you to do linear merging
=> Create a new branch 
- Git branch demo
=> Create a file
- vim newfile
=> Add
- Git add .
=> commit
- git commit -m "Message"
=> Rebse from 
- Git rebase master
=> Go to master & to do rebase
